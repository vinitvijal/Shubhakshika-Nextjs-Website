            description: "Kamlesh faced the issue of gender identity, maybe due to his abduction by a transgender in his childhood. Kamlesh, a biological male, wanted to change due to the influence of the Transgender community who made him feel important. Kamlesh began to open up through a series of personalised and family counselling sessions. He was always told that he was free to convert but only if he actually wanted. Now Kamlesh has refused to convert and is focused on his future.",

            description: "Rahul was found bagging at Badli metro station. He belonged to a family of professional beggars. It was a challenge to bring the child to centre but aggressive counselling and perseverance resulted in success. The NGO could not only change the child but also convinced his family to take up a respectable job. We generated the seed money for an e-rickshaw with the help of Bharat Vikas Parishad. The boyâ€™s father now owns and drives an e-rickshaw to earns his living.",

One brother is employed in lift repair, while another has left home. The family continues to face financial difficulties. On Friday, Mohit discovered an iPhone XR in a hospital in Rohini. He took the phone and returned it to school, where he handed it over to Mr. Gautam, the students' mobilizer. Thanks to MF's quick thinking and moral judgment, we were able to locate the phone's owner after a full day of efforts. We are proud of the positive changes Mohit has shown and his dedication to doing what is right. The following day, we honored his integrity and effort by applauding him during the school assembly, recognizing his commendable actions and boosting his morale.",

His father has passed away, and his mother is employed as a factory worker. Monu is suffering from cerebral palsy. He cannot use his right limbs properly. He has difficulty in walking. But he is very intelligent and is determined to make a successful career for himself. On account of his poverty he is not able to afford many essentialities. We have assisted him in obtaining his disability certificate which entitles him to a pension from the Delhi government. We wish him the best and promise to stand by him always.",
